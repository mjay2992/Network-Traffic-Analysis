Investigation Notes
This file documents specific technical steps and observations from the digital forensic investigation.

Wireshark Filters Used
?FTP Commands: `ftp.request.command` to analyze FTP command and response exchanges.
?File Uploads: `ftp.request.command == "STOR"` to identify files uploaded by the attacker.
?HTTP Analysis: `http.response.code == 404` to flag potential covert communication.
?TCP Stream: Used "Follow TCP Stream" to reconstruct FTP sessions for detailed analysis.

Key Observations
?The attacker used anonymous login (username: anonymous, password: anonymous) to access the FTP server.
?Uploaded files included `Pwdump7.exe`, `libeay32.dll`, and `hashlist.txt`, indicating potential credential harvesting.
?The FTP server ran on Windows XP, a deprecated system with known vulnerabilities.
?HTTP 404 responses were flagged for further steganographic analysis.

Additional Notes
?No password hashes were extracted, so John the Ripper/Hashcat were not used.
?Steghide was prepared for steganographic analysis but not applied in this phase.
